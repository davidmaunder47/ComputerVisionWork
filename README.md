# ComputerVisionWork

This GitHub file is a compilation of various computer vision projects I have made. There are a couple of object recognition projects, and some conventional object area classification projects as well. The conventional object area classification models use classical computer vision algorithms. I havenâ€™t added weight and config files to run these models, since they are too large to add to GitHub. I have added my papers to this page instead. If you want the weights file for a project, please email me at johndmaunder@gmail.com and I will send you the weights file.
