# ComputerVisionWork

This GitHub file is a compilation of various computer vision projects I have made. These computer vision projects include some object recognition and classical object area classification projects. 

Conventional Computer Vision Algorithms:

Edge Detection -Used to detect and outline the area of a leaf(s) in an image.

Skin Detection - Filter exposed skin pixels of a person(s) in an image. The background will turn black and skin pixels will turn white.


Convolutional Neural Networks (Deep Learning):

Mask Detection - Uses two different Deep Learning Models (Convolutional Neural Networks - CNN's) to detect mask wearing.

An Investigation Using Neural Networks - Uses a Yolov4 Deep Learning Model to detect individuals for Search and Rescue Operations

Fashion Mnist Dataset Work - Is a Google Doc used to detect various articles of clothing using a custom made Deep Neural Network
