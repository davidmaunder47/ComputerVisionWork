# ComputerVisionWork

This GitHub file is a compilation of various computer vision projects I have made. There are a couple of object recognition projects, and some conventional object area classification projects as well. The conventional object area classification models use classical computer vision algorithms. I havenâ€™t added weight and config files to run these models, since they are too large to add to GitHub. I have added my papers to this page instead. If you want the weights file for a project, please email me at johndmaunder@gmail.com and I will send you the weights file. 

Conventional Computer Vision Algorithms:

Edge Detection - Detection the outline and area of a leaf(s) in an image.

Skin Detection - Filter exposed skin on a person(s) in an image. Background will turn black, skin pixels will turn white.


Convolutional Neural Networks (Deep Learning):

Mask Detection - Uses three different Deep Learning Models (Convolutional Neural Networks - CNN's) to detect Mask Wearing.

An Investigation Using Neural Networks - Yolov4 Deep Learning Model to detect individuals for Search and Rescue Operations

Fashion Mnist Dataset Work - Google Doc used to detect various clothing using a custom made Deep Neural Network
