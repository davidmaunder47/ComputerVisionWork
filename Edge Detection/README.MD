This project uses various classical computer vision algoirthms to detect the outline of various leafs in an image. The idea behind this project is we can calculate the area of the leafs automatically if we can get the correct pixel count. 

The project should be able to be imported to Pycharm and run if all dependencies are installed with no error.
