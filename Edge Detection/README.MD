This project uses various classical computer vision algoirthms to detect the outline of various leafs in an image. The purpose of this project is to calculate the area of the leafs automatically. 

The project can be run in PyCharm if all required dependencies are installed. 

The images in the folders are samples of the leafs we are trying to filter and detect.
