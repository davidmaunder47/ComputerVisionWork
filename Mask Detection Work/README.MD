This project is using three different Convolutional Neural Networks to detect if a person is:

1.Wearing a Mask Correctly, 

2. Not Wearing a Mask Correctly, 

3. Partly Wearing a Mask Correctly.


The Dataset was pulled from an online source. Two different Yolo algorithms were used to detect the above three classes.
